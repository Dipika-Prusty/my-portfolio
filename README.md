# my-portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio! ðŸ‘‹
Here, I have uploaded my first task given by CodSoft, I created a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. This project helped me enhance my skills in web development and gave me valuable experience in designing and building a professional online presence.
Explore my projects, skills, and experiences to see how I'm leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and create meaningful applications. Feel free to connect with me for collaborations or to discuss tech opportunities!

Thank you to the CodSoft team for this incredible opportunity and to everyone who has supported me on this journey so far. I look forward to tackling more challenges and growing further in this internship. 

Check out my portfolio.

Thank you.
